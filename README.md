The RESUME PARSER AGENT MVP is the AI Agent workflow which extracts the necessary contents such as year_of_education , degree , degree , ielts/toefl score , etc. essentials which are necessary and returns them.
App.py is the backend which handles the logic and communication with the n8n Agent.
I am thinking to normalize the cgpa, ielts/toefl/etc. to the grade of 1 to 10 which will then be used for the ML Model directly as the ready made input.
Pls feel free to share your suggestions, advice leader
